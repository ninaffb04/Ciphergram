Planning:

Description:
Enigmagram will be a website where users can encrypt and decrypt messages using four methods. Caesar Cipher, Vignere Cipher, Bacon's Cipher, and Color-based Cipher. 
They will then have the opportunity to send these encrypted and decrypted messages over email to their friends. They can also go and decrypt the messages after reading a small about page of how to.

Features: 
- Slider for caesar cipher shift
- Email sending
- Login/register
- Chaining
- Key input filed for vignere
- Option to do bacon's cipher with case sensitivity
- About pages with caesar cipher wheel/frequency tables/ etc.
Challenge: Message sending within website not just email.

Tools:
- API to display the color blocks
- Postgres database to save register information and cipher code
- File upload for about pages.
- Challenge: API or something for in website messages.
